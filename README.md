# ChainedEventEmitter

ChainedEventEmitter is a an implementation of the EventEmitter found in Node.js, 
based on EventEmitter2, but adding the ability to return a promise in an event
handler, so that the next handler waits for the previous to finish before 
firing.  As well, `emit()` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the
handlers have fired.

## Features

 - Everything from EventEmitter2
 - Event chains

## Differences (Non breaking, compatible with existing EventEmitter, EventEmitter2)

 - The constructor takes a configuration object.
 
```javascript
    var ChainedEmitter = require('ChainedEmitter').EventEmitter;
    var server = new ChainedEmitter({
      parallel: true, // fire second handler before the first resolves, defaults to false
    });
```

 - Returning a promise

```javascript
    var q = require('q')
    server.on('foo.*', function(value1, value2) {
      return q.defer().promise
    });
```

## API

#### emitter.addListener(event, listener)
#### emitter.on(event, listener)

Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.  If 
the listener returns a `Q` promise, the promise returned by `emit()` will not 
resolve until the returned promise resolves.  If the `parallel` configuration
is `false`, the next handler will also wait to fire before the returned promise
resolves.  If you return anything but a promise (including `undefined` or 
`null`), the next action will happen immediately.

```javascript
    server.on('data', function(value1, value2, value3 /* accepts any number of expected values... */) {
      var me = q.defer();
      return me.promise; // wait for me!
    });
```

```javascript
    server.on('data', function(value) {
      return; // don't wait!
    });
```
